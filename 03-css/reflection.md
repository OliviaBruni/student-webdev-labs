1. I was able to navigate this lab largely on my own. I had to research some CSS rules as the lab continued, and I required some video support, but I never had to look up the solutions to these activities/sections. Additionally, the flow of the activities was extremely intuitive, and included many ideas from previous lessons. I enjoyed this lab the most thus far.
2. This lab was extremely successful in helping me understand the complexities of CSS and its applications.
3. Regarding accessibility, I think it would have been interesting to require students to set up a media-query for screen readers.
4. I have little to no other notes for improvement on this lab, I was impressed by how easy it was to learn with this format.

### Accessibility

Enter your reflections on this section here.

After testing these lab sections using WAVE, W3C validator, and my personal screen reader, these sections have been thoroughly checked for accessibility purposes. With more files and pages, this became much more difficult but this is still an extremely valuable function for those who have disabilities in order to help them navigate the web. Additionally, during the 06-media-queries section, I found that there exists media queries that can be run when using a screen reader. After navigating the internet a little bit with a screen reader for one of our activities, I'm shocked that this utility is not used more frequently.

1. Valid Code - According to the W3C validators, the code for both HTML and CSS files are valid.
2. Wave AIM - Wave AIM helped me identify the accessibility issues within the HTML code itself. There were some issues with the original files for this lab, and I fixed all but the non-normative warnings (specifically about the section tags requiring a heading tag as an immediate child)
3. Checklist Markdown File - All sections have been completed besides from the JaveScript section in this checklist.
