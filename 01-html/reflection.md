### HTML

1. I was able to complete these exercises on my own. Aside from looking up the syntax technicalities, I was able to recreate the given examples very easily.
2. The exercises in this section were pretty helpful in understanding the foundational elements in HTML. I found the table exercise (exercise 3 I believe) to be the most helpful, as it gave the most details about the technicalities one will run into.
3. I'm sure we will get into it moving forward, but I have taken Web Development courses in the past so I know that HTML can get much more in-depth than what was covered in this lab.
4. No, I believe that this was a great introductory lab to HTML.

1. Valid Code - Given the W3C Markup Validation tool, the code I wrote is considered valid. I had to fix some things in both Exercise 3 and Exercise 4, but they were minimal regarding tag ordering and also tag layering.
2. Wave AIM - According to the accessibility tool, I had some small kinks to work out. In Exercise 2, I was unable to resolve the issue as there was not much to add to the alt text. The rest of the issues were surrounding heading issues and for Exercise 4 the issue was the lack of fieldset and legend tags.
3. Checklist Markdown File - This file has been filled out and completed according to its listed instructions.
