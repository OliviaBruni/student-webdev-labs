1. I was able to navigate this lab on my own. However, given the grading I have seen from my other assignments, I am concerned that I will lose points for instructions that were not entirely clear. For example, the non-normative section tag usage warning I would get on the HTML W3c validation tool, as well as some others. Maybe a layout for expected implemenation/styling of the assignments would be helpful.
2. Flexbox is very difficult to understand, and while I had some difficulty I was able to learn the fundamentals of Flexbox and the details therein. I think some clarification on the vertical alignment of elements would be helpful.

### Accessibility

Implementing for accessibility is a major concern when it comes to website access and features. I am curious what to add to the HTML of a Flexbox page in order to make it more accessible. Such as a "tab through" ability.
