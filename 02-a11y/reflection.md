1. I was able to figure out this web notebook on my own, after asking some questions from the professor in class. Specifically, what to focus on. Then, after looking at the slides from previous lectures, I was able to figure out exactly what to do to this form to make it as accessible as possible.
   An issue I ran into, however, was the overall vagueness of the accessibility implementation for ARIA. It was difficult to understand what exact accessibility items/tags were needed in the form. But I know that is probably accurate to how implementing accessibility usually is, and after a lot of research I think I was able to figure it out.
2. This exercise was really helpful for learning the implementation of ARIA and accessiility tags. Having a checklist of the tests to pass was helpful (like the WAVE evaluation). It was a challenge to figure out how to make the form look its best, work with a screen reader, and include other functionality/accessibility items.
3. Regarding accessibility, I think it would have been interesting to see the issues common websites run into. We could learn how to avoid things like getting caught in a loop, stuck at a certain point, etc.
4. I think some more clear instructions related to the assignment itself would have been helpful. Either on the assignment page or otherwise.

1. Valid Code - According to the W3C markdown file, my HTML code was valid. There were no issues when I ran the file through this test.
2. Wave AIM - According to this tool, my HTML code is now valid. This code was not originally valid, and some things I had to update included adding ARIA landmarks, adjusting the form radio buttons, adding labels to all inputs, etc. After fixing these issues, the site seems much more accessible.
3. Checklist Markdown File - All HTML sections have been completed, as this was the focus of this lab. The details of these are listed above, and Prettier has automatically formatted my code throughout the process.
