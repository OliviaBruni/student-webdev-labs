### HTML

1. I was able to navigate this lab extremely easily, with some internet research to look up relevant class names for Bootstrap. It was intuitive.
2. I feel as though I have a thorough understanding of Bootstrap now, and will be able to easily implement it for my future web development classes. It almost makes me question why we learned the fundamentals in the first place, just due to its effectiveness. Of course, the fundamentals are extremely helpful too.

### Accessibility

Enter your reflections on this section here.

1. Bootstrap made it much easier to implement accessibility into the websites we create. The accessibility aspects are easy to implement, however we sometimes lose the HTML tag accessibility in favor of the Bootstrap functionality.
2. All of the code checks passed, and with minimal edits to the HTML.
