## Reflection Document

### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

This lab in particular required a lot of research in order for me to complete. I understand that with JavaScript being introduced, this was pretty much a given, but I spent a lot of time and effort figuring out how to complete this lab. I was able to do sections 01-05 on my own, however sections 06-07 I needed to follow the video walkthrough. However, I learned a ton about JavaScript and have these lab exercises to thank.

### Accessibility

1. Wave AIM - no issues, nothing to fix
2. w3c validation - issues with HTML script tag, as well as 06-fetch.html loading img styling.
3. Prettier was automatically implemented, no issues.

   Generally, the implementation of accessibility elements were extremely easy in this lab. Especially given that the HTML and other elements were made to be accessible from the start.
