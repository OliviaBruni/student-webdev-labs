### HTML

1. I was able to navigate this lab with some help from W3School guides. I had some issues regarding the flow of this assignment, especially given the grading criteria that I recieved on some other assignments. I think that more clear instruction on the specific criteria of recreating images of layouts is important. Additionally, I think it should be made clear when HTML needs to be updated/is not up to standards.
2. This lab was successful in helping me understand the CSS Grid layouts and CSS Grid Areas. I had no trouble understanding this. I think that naming the area elements could have been more clear, but I was able to understand after some research.

### Accessibility

1. Valid Code - According to the W3C validators, the code for both HTML and CSS files are valid.
2. Wave AIM - Wave AIM helped me identify the accessibility issues within the HTML code itself. There were some issues with the original files for this lab, fixed with adding some simple h1 elements.
3. Checklist Markdown File - All sections have been completed except for the JaveScript section in this checklist.
