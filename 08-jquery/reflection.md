### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

1. This lab assignment required me to look up some formatting syntax for jQuery, which I believe is expected for a new library/language. The majority of what I had to research/use the videos for was for the ajax section. Otherwise, jQuery was relatively intuitive to pick up effectively.
2. Some small issues with the lab I noticed included issues with the HTML code itself, including links to images and tags for those images. The relative links to some stylesheets were incorrect as well.

### Accessibility

1. jQuery makes it much easier to code accessible webpages, and is a lot less strenuous than typical Javascript. Thus learning this has been an excellent tool in my web development took kit.
